# Attendance_system_using_Face_Recognition
## Description
Very few biometric technologies are attracting as much attention as facial recognition. Facial recognition technology offers a host of benefits such as in authentication, monitoring, access control, indexing, and maintenance of surveillance applications. This project aims to change the way attendance is taken in classrooms, workspaces and almost everywhere with the help of deep-learnng libraries in python.

## Requirements
- Python 3.3+ or Python 2.7
- macos(or linux) or windows 
- Open-CV(version 2)
- Python face_recognition library( for information about installation go to https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition)
- Numpy library from pythn

## Usage
- Download the above directory of project directly using code drop-down menu.
- Save the required images for attendance with their correct names(the images should be in .jpg or .jpeg format) in the images folder.
- Run the code and you can see your webcam will be on and showing your image.(By default we have set it to an internal webcam. However if you intend to use an external webcam, do as below)
Change the setting in video-capture-line(number 46) of codefile attendance.py to

- You can see the updated attendence.csv file by opening it.

## Applications in Real Life
1. Automated Time Tracking System
Entry and exit time monitoring done manually or with other biometric systems can be fully automated with facial recognition attendance systems. 
2. Cost-Effective
A facial recognition attendance system can save business resources by automatic employee time tracking. It is a cost-effective method as the small scale companies can’t afford biometrics. 
•	Increase employee productivity by 10%
•	Cut administrative costs by 5-10%

3. Touchless Sign In System: A Post Pandemic Requirement
Post pandemic there has been a significant increase in demand and adoption of contactless technologies. It is a touchless process so reduces the risk of virus transmission.
5. More Accurate and Better Worker Attendance
With a face recognition attendance system, the entire environment is automated. You won’t just take the attendance but also automatically record the entry-exit time of the employees.
